## Goal of the Project:

    The goal of the Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator project was to provide a platform to simulate and compare various page replacement algorithms like FIFO, LRU, MRU, OPR. 

    The project was aimed at providing an easy-to-use web application that can be used by students, researchers, and professionals to study and compare the performance of different page replacement algorithms. 

## Tech Stack:

    React.js
    Javascript
    HTML
    CSS
    Material-UI
    Firebase
    AWS

## Process of Development:

    The development of the Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator project was a multi-step process that involved designing the user interface, choosing appropriate algorithms to implement, developing the application using Reactjs, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Firebase, and deploying the application on AWS Amplify. The following are the steps involved in the development of this project:

User Interface Design:

    The user interface was designed using modern web design principles and guidelines to ensure a seamless user experience. The user interface was designed to be intuitive, user-friendly, and responsive, which means that it can be accessed from any device.
    
Algorithm Selection: 

    After designing the user interface, the next step was to choose the algorithms to implement. The following algorithms were implemented in the project:

    1. First-In-First-Out (FIFO) algorithm
    2. Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm
    3. Most Recently Used (MRU) algorithm
    4. Optimal Page Replacement (OPR) algorithm

Application Development: 

    The Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator application was developed using Reactjs, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Firebase. The application was designed to be modular, scalable, and easy to maintain. The application was tested rigorously to ensure that it performs well under different loads.

Deployment:

    The final step in the development process was to deploy the application on AWS Amplify. AWS Amplify is a cloud hosting platform that provides scalable, secure, and high-performance hosting for web applications.

Features of the Project:

    The Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator project comes with several features that make it a useful tool for studying and comparing different page replacement algorithms. Some of the important features of the project are:

User-friendly Interface:

    The user interface is intuitive and easy to use, even for non-technical users.

Multiple Algorithms: 

    The application supports multiple page replacement algorithms, including FIFO, LRU, MRU, and OPR.

Real-time Simulation: 

    The application simulates page replacement in real-time, allowing users to visualize the performance of different algorithms.

Interactive Charts:

    The application generates interactive charts that show the performance of different algorithms over time.

Firebase Integration: 

    The application uses Firebase save user queries coming from contact form.

Scalable and Reliable: 

    The application is hosted on AWS Amplify
